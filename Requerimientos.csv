EVLA Operations System SRS.,nfr
Security The Backend System needs a robust security mechanism in place so that unauthorized users are not allowed access.,nfr
Authorized users are expected to be restricted to software and hardware development testing maintenance and operations personnel.,nfr
All users of the Backend System must be uniquely identified.,nfr
This could be done via a username and associated password scheme that would authenticate and authorize the user access to the system and if applicable grant the user access to restricted or controlled parts of the system.,nfr
If a user cannot be identified they will not be given access.,nfr
In order to monitor all past access to the system all attempts to access the system should be logged.,nfr
Users needs and expectations from the system will be different.,nfr
Systems operations should be given unrestricted access to all aspects of the system and should have the authority to grant and revoke privileges on a peruser basis.,nfr
Development testing and maintenance personnel on the other hand require access to some parts of the system but not all indicating that an access level is needed that allows privileges to be granted on a peruser and whatdoyouneedtodo basis.,nfr

The Registration module acts as an interface between the police and citizens and it eases the approach interaction and information exchange between police and complainants.,fr
Investigation After a complaint is initiated police initiates the investigation process.,fr
The Investigation module of the CCTNS facilitates the investigation process and introduces operational efficiencies by automating most of the tasks that take place after initial entries are made during Registration.,fr
Prosecution Interfacing with the courts during the prosecution of cases is an integral part of the responsibilities of police personnel.,fr
A designated constable from each police station constantly interfaces with the courts.,fr
The Prosecution module of the CCTNS aids this interfacing by providing a platform to record entries of the court interactions.,fr
Search The Search module of the CCTNS gives police personnel the ability to execute a basic or advanced search on cases.,fr
Using the search functionality police personnel can search for a particular person type of crime modus operandi property etc.,fr
It also gives the user the ability to customize the results view by criminalaccused or by cases.,fr
It makes reporting easy for police by enabling them to execute different types of queries such as monthly reporting RTI related etc.,fr
Citizen Interface The Citizen Interface module of the CCTNS acts as a conduit for the information exchange between citizens and police unitspersonnel.,fr
Citizens can use it as a tool to get information or acknowledgements from police.,fr
The police in turn can use it to respond to citizens with very little turnaround time.,fr
It improves overall productivity by helping citizens and police to cut short the drudgery of large amounts of paperwork.,fr
Navigation The Navigation module of the CCTNS provides role based landing pages which help in navigating through the CCTNS application.,fr
It shows information such as cases assigned alerts pending tasks etc hence helping police personnel to plan better and execute with greater efficiency.,fr

With a proper configuration information such as act and sections state specific data castes tribes property information etc.,fr
can be created updated and deleted.,fr
The functional requirements for each of the modules are provided as A to A in arate enclosures.,fr
The nonfunctional requirements specify the qualitative attributes such as userfriendliness and performance of the system that are critical for the increased useracceptance of the application.,nfr
Help Module.,nfr
The solution should provide detailed contextsensitive help material for all the possible actions and scenarios on all user interfaces in the application.,nfr
The help should be accessible to the users both in the offline and online mode Support Module.,nfr
The solution should provide an interface for the user to log any defects or enhancement requests on the application and track thereafter.,nfr
The solution should send alerts e.g.,nfr
email SMS to the user if the user chooses to whenever any action has been taken on the alert.,nfr
The solution should enable the user to track the submitted defect or enhancement request.,nfr
The solution should enable the helpdesk user to view the reports on the submitted defects or enhancement requests categorywise statuswise and age wise.,nfr
The support solution should be accessible to the users both from within the application and also outside the application through a browser interface.,nfr
Audit Module.,nfr
An audit trail is a record of actions taken by either the user or the system triggers.,nfr
This includes actions taken by users or Administrators or actions initiated automatically by the system as a result of system parameters.,nfr
The System must keep an unalterable audit trail capable of automatically capturing and storing information about All the actions createreadupdatedelete that are taken upon the critical entities case suspect property in the system The user initiating and or carrying out the action The date and time of the event.,nfr
Administrative parameters The word unalterable is to mean that the audit trail data cannot be modified in any way or deleted by any user it be subject to redepartment and copying to removable media if required so long as its contents remain unchanged.,nfr
Once the audit trail functionality has been activated the System must track events without manual intervention and store in the audit trail information about them.,nfr
The System must maintain the audit trail for as long as required which will be at least for the life of the case to which it refers.,nfr
The System must ensure that audit trail data is available for inspection on request so that a specific event can be identified and all related data made accessible and that this can be achieved by authorised external personnel who have little or no familiarity with the system.,nfr
The System must be able to export audit trails for specified cases without affecting the audit trail stored by the System.,nfr
This functionality can be used by external auditors who wish to examine or analyse system activity.,nfr
The System must be able to capture and store violations i.e.,nfr
A users attempts to access a case to which he is denied access and where violations can validly be attempted attempted violations of access control mechanisms.,nfr
The System must at a minimum be able to provide reports for actions on cases organised By case By user In chronological sequence.,nfr
The System should be able to provide reports for actions on cases organised by workstation and where technically appropriate by network address.,nfr

Access Module.,nfr
The System must allow the user to limit access to cases to specified users or user groups.,nfr
The system should provide for rolebased control for the functionality within .,nfr
the system.,nfr
The System must allow a user to be a member of more than one group.,nfr
The System must allow only adminusers to set up user profiles and allocate users to groups.,nfr
The System should allow a user to stipulate which other users or groups can access cases.,nfr
The System must allow changes to security attributes for groups or users such as access rights security level privileges password allocation and management to be made only by superuser.,nfr
If a user requests access to or searches for a case which he does not have the right to access the System must provide one of the following responses selectable at configuration time display title and metadata display the existence of a case but not its title or other metadata do not display any case information or indicate its existence in any way.,nfr
These options are presented in order of increasing security.,nfr
Note that the requirement in the third option i.e.,nfr
the most stringent implies that the System must not include such cases in any count of search results this level of security is normally appropriate for cases dealing with matters such as national security.,nfr
If a user performs a quick or advanced search the System must never include in the search result list any record which the user does not have the right to access.,nfr
If the System allows users to make unauthorised attempts to access cases it must log these in the audit trail.,nfr
Any access to cases and all other activities involving the cases and related documents or data should also need to be stored in the audit trail to ensure legal admissibility and to assist in data recovery.,nfr
Ease of Use.,nfr
All error messages produced by the System must be meaningful so that they can be appropriately acted upon by the users who are likely to see them.,nfr
Ideally each error message will be accompanied by explanatory text and an indication of the actions which the user can take in response to the error.,nfr
The System must employ a single set of user interface rules or a small number of sets to provide a familiar and common look and feel for the application.,nfr
The System must be able to display several entities cases suspects simultaneously.,nfr
The interfaces must be made customizable or userconfigurable to the extent possible.g.,nfr
the displayed columns in the table move resize modify the appearance.,nfr
Such configurations must be saved in the user profile.,nfr
The System user interface must be suitable for users with special needs that is compatible with specialist software that be used and with appropriate interface guidelines.,nfr
The System must provide End User and Administrator functions which are easy to use and intuitive throughout.,nfr
The System must allow persistent defaults for data entry where desirable.,nfr
These defaults should include userdefinable values values same as previous item values derived from context e.g.,nfr
date file reference user identifier.,nfr
Frequentlyexecuted System transactions must be designed so that they can be completed with a small number of interactions e.g.,nfr
mouse clicks.,nfr
Where the System employs a graphical user interface it must allow users to customise it.,nfr
Customisation should include but need not be limited to the following changes menu contents layout of screens use of function keys onscreen colours fonts and font sizes Usability.,nfr
The user interfaces should be designed to make them userintuitive.,nfr
The user interfaces of the system should comply with Standard ISO.,nfr
ICT accessibility ISO shall be the standard for guidance on ICT accessibility.,nfr
Application user interfaces to meet its requirements and recommendations.,nfr
Software accessibility ISO shall be the standard for guidance on software accessibility.,nfr
User interfaces should meet its requirements and recommendations.,nfr
Content accessibility WCAG.,nfr
shall be the standard used for guidance on content accessibility.,nfr
The application logo to be available on all pages as a link to the home page.,nfr
Providing text equivalents for nontext media objects All nontext media objects such as graphical images or video should be provided with alternative equivalent textual descriptions andor with equivalent textbased functionality.,nfr
Making navigation selfdescriptive Navigation should be designed to help users understand where they are where they have been and where they can go next.,nfr
General guidance on achieving selfdescriptiveness is given in ISO.,nfr
Showing users where they are Each presentation segment page or window should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is in the navigation structure and of the current segment position with respect to the overall structure.,nfr
Offering alternative access paths Alternative access paths for navigating to a specific unit of content should be offered to support different navigation strategies.,nfr
Minimizing navigation effort The number of navigation steps needed to reach a certain piece of content should be minimized as long as different mental models navigation strategies and tasks of the user are taken into account.,nfr
Splash screens should be avoided unless they provide useful content or feedback about the application state to the user.,nfr
If a splash screen is used a navigation option to skip it should be offered.,nfr
Avoiding opening unnecessary windows Additional windows such as new browser windows or popup windows should only be opened if this supports the users task.,nfr
Opening new windows can distract confuse or impede users for a variety of reasons.,nfr
They can superimpose the priy window hiding relevant information.,nfr
They could make it cognitively more difficult to understand the navigation structure with negative effects on both usability and accessibility.,nfr
They also require additional user actions for closing unwanted windows.,nfr
Vertical scrolling should be minimized.,nfr
This be done by placing important information at the top and providing links to information that is further down the page.,nfr
Horizontal scrolling should be avoided wherever possible.,nfr
Designing for input device independence User interfaces should be designed to allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices.,nfr
The ability to choose between different input devices for activating controls such as links fields and buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode mobile users and users with disabilities.,nfr
In general device independence can be achieved if the functionality is operable via a keyboard.,nfr
Making user interfaces robust User interfaces should be designed to be as robust as possible in the face of changing technology.,nfr
This encompasses being able to present content containing newer technologies by older user agents as well as .,nfr
designing content to be usable with future technologies.,nfr
Acceptable opening download times Application pages should be designed and implemented so that there are acceptable opening times and download times for the expected range of technical contexts of use e.g.,nfr
bandwidth between the application and the user.,nfr
This is particularly important for frequently accessed pages or pages that are important for user navigation and exploration such as the home page.,nfr
Minimizing user errors Potential user errors as well as the effort needed to recover from errors should be minimized.,nfr
Providing clear error messages The content of error messages shown on the pages or special error pages should clearly state the reason why the error occurred and if possible actions the user can take to resolve the error.,nfr
Users expect error messages to be in the same language as the user interface.,nfr
Using appropriate formats units of measurement or currency When designing user interfaces for use by diverse groups input and output of information elements such as currency units of measurement temperatures date and time phone numbers address or postal codes should be designed so that they are usable.,nfr
Making text resizable by the user Text should be able to be resized by the user using functions provided by the user agent or other appropriate means i.e.,nfr
see ISO.,nfr
Text quality The quality of textual content with respect to spelling and gram should be sufficient so as not to impede readability.,nfr
Writing style The reading and understanding of the textual content on the screen should be supported by suitable means including the use of short sentences the division of the text into shorter chunks or the presentation of content items in the form of bullet points.,nfr
Supporting text skimming Fast skimming of text should be supported by the provision of clear links bulleted lists highlighted keywords logical headings and short phrases and sentences.,nfr
Readability of text Text presented on the pages should be readable taking into account the expected display characteristics and spatial arrangement.,nfr
ISO shall be consulted for screen text legibility requirements.,nfr
Distinguishable withinpage links Withinpage links should be clearly distinguishable from other links that lead to a different page.,nfr
Withinpage links are shown with dashed rather than solid underlines.,nfr
Avoiding link overload Text pages containing large proportions of links should .,nfr
be formatted so that the presence of links does not impede the readability of the text.,nfr
Using familiar terminology for navigation links Navigation links particularly links representing the main navigation structure should be labelled with terms that are familiar to the user based on hisher general knowledge prior experience in the application domain or experience of using other systems.,nfr
Using descriptive link labels The target or purpose of a link should be directly indicated by its label avoiding generic labels such as go or click here except where the purpose of the link is clear from its context on the page or the labels have commonly understood semantics in the particular application domain.,nfr
Using appropriate terminology specific to the users tasks and information needs is important for making the content easy to understand.,nfr
Marking links opening new windows Links that open new browser windows or popup windows should be clearly ked.,nfr
Distinguishing navigation links from controls Navigation links should be clearly distinguishable from controls activating some action.,nfr
Typical action types in user interfaces include manipulating application data performing searches communication actions such as opening a new email window or starting a chat function and Hpresentationrelated actions such as sorting a list of search results.,nfr
Providing printable document versions If a document is either too long dispersed over several pages or in a specific layout that is not suitable for online reading a printerfriendly version of the document should be provided that prints the content in a form acceptable to the user e.g.,nfr
in the expected layout paper format or orientation.,nfr
Use of white space White space on a page i.e.,nfr
space filled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual skimming of the page.,nfr
While white space is an important means of visually organizing the different content elements on a page if the distance between the blocks of information displayed becomes too large rapid skimming of the page can be impeded.,nfr
Selecting appropriate page lengths The length of a page should be selected so as to support the priy purpose and use of the page.,nfr
Short pages are generally more appropriate for homepages navigation pages or overview pages that need to be read quickly.,nfr
Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart.,nfr
Using colour Colour should be used with care taking into account human capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour and not as the only means of conveying information.,nfr
Color should never be the only means of coding.,nfr
Some users have difficulties in perceiving certain colors or color combinations .,nfr
colorblindness.,nfr
Using frames with care If frames are used care should be taken to avoid possible problems for example those involving the use of the back button bookking of pages or scrolling of information.,nfr
When frames are used it is important to title each frame and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other.,nfr
Providing alternatives to framebased presentation If frames are used an alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be provided.,nfr
Providing alternative textonly pages When style sheets andor frames are turned off it should be possible for the user to read and understand the page alternatively the user should be provided with an equivalent alternative textonly page.,nfr
Consistent page layout Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes supporting the user in finding similar information at the same position on different pages.,nfr
Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure.,nfr
Frequently however different pages have different purposes and types of content.,nfr
In such cases pages can usually be grouped in different categories using one layout scheme for each category consistently.,nfr
Placing title information consistently Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages.,nfr
Observing principles of human perception When designing application pages the general principles of human perception should be taken into account.,nfr
The International Standards mentioned below shall be consulted for guidance.,nfr
Practical guidelines for presenting information to the user are to be found in ISO.,nfr
Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO to ISO.,nfr
ISO gives guidance about menus ISO about command dialogues ISO about direct manipulation and ISO about forms.,nfr
In addition when designing multimedia information presentations the design principles and recommendations described in ISO to ISO should be taken into account.,nfr
Appropriate content presentation also plays a key role in accessibility.,nfr
Linking back to the home page or landk pages Each page should contain a link leading to the home page of the application or to a landk page that is easy to recognize for the user.,nfr
Providing a site map A arate navigation overview such as a site map should be provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form.,nfr
Consistency between navigation components and content If navigation components or overviews are shown in conction with associated content consistency between the navigation component and the content shown should be maintained by indicating in the navigation component e.g.,nfr
highlighting the topic .,nfr
currently visible in the content area.,nfr
Placing navigation components consistently Navigation components should be placed consistently on the pages or in the framesets in the pages of the application.,nfr
Individualization and user adaptation Adapting the content and the navigation of a user interface to individual users or user groups can be a useful mechanism for providing information that is of interest to the users and for making access to relevant information more efficient.,nfr
User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible.,nfr
Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e.,nfr
individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e.,nfr
such as employees of different levels citizens etc monitoring the users behaviour and adapting to the users goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user based on the behaviour of all users or a user group.,nfr
Taking account of the users tasks and information needs When providing different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups the tasks and information needs of these user groups should be taken into consideration.,nfr
Making individualization and adaptation evident It should be made evident to the user when individualization andor adaptation are used.,nfr
Making user profiles evident If predefined user profiles or userspecified profiles are used for individualizing or adapting content the profile currently used should be made evident.,nfr
If profiles are used it is important to provide users with information about this concept and its implications.,nfr
Allowing users to see and change profiles If userspecified profiles are used users should be able to see modify and delete that profile on demand.,nfr
The user interfaces of the system should follow the guidelines specified under www.usability.gov System Availability.,nfr
The System must be available to users from to on.,nfr
The planned downtime for the System must not exceed hours per.,nfr
The System is considered to be down if any user is unable to perform any normal System function and if this failure is attributed to any component of the System other than the workstation.,nfr
Unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed per.,nfr
The number of incidents of unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed per.,nfr
In the event of any software or hardware failure it must be possible to restore the System with inline synchronization within no more than hours.,nfr
Performance and Scalability.,nfr
The System must provide adequate response times for commonly performed functions under both standard and peak conditions.,nfr
The System must be able to perform a simple search within seconds and a advanced search multiple search criteria within seconds regardless of the storage capacity or number of cases in the system.,nfr
In this context performing a search means returning a result list.,nfr
It does not include retrieving the records themselves.,nfr
The System must be able to retrieve and display within seconds the case which has been accessed within the previous months regardless of storage capacity or number of cases in the system.,nfr
This requirement is intended to allow for rapid retrieval of frequentlyused cases on the understanding that frequency of use is typically correlated with recent use.,nfr
The System must be able to retrieve and display within seconds the case which has not been accessed within the previous months regardless of storage capacity or number of cases in the system.,nfr
This requirement is intended to allow for cases where cases used infrequently are stored on slower media than more active records.,nfr
The System be scaleable and must not have any features which would preclude use in small or large police stations with varying numbers of cases handled.,nfr
External Interface Requirements User Interfaces Bootstrap offers a standardized UI framework that maintains a consistent set of user interface tools that HousingU will utilize.,fr
All frontfacing interfaces will follow Bootstrap design guidelines.,fr
Every page will include a standard header including the HousingU logo and important links.,fr
Additionally each page will contain a general footer that includes other important links.,fr
HousingU does not use any hardware interfaces Software Interfaces Our product will be run on a Heroku platform in the cloud which essentially receives our code from a command line call referencing our GitHub repo compiles our code and hosts it in an isolated Unix v,fr
This hooks into our database and then deploys it on our domain.,fr
Afterward the only messages passed would be GET and POST requests from the user as well as calls to add remove or select data from our database Communications Interfaces Our site will be secured via an HTTPS connection to prevent session hijacking.,fr
We will use CAPTCHA images to ensure all communication originates from a human and thus prevent spam data to a certain extent.,fr

Software Quality Attributes Correctness Our product will implement a method to verify correctness of rental listings.,nfr
One way we can do this is with a CAPTCHA image so as to limit the postings to human users only.,nfr
This will prevent automated spam bots from posting on our site.,nfr
Beyond that me must also verify the validity of listings.,nfr
We do this by hooking into the Google Maps API and cross referencing entered addresses with Google to verify the address is real.,nfr
Furthermore we can impose a check to prevent duplicate listings of the same property Adaptability Our product must be adaptable in the sense that it displays properly and functionally to a user no matter what screen size they are using.,nfr
This is important because today more than of website traffic originates from a mobile device or tablet.,nfr
We will accomplish this using a responsive CSS design that will downscale our layout according to the screen size of the viewer.,nfr
This could be a strict downscale in which the content does not change it simply shrinks or it could be a full content switch in which larger items are replaced by smaller phone oriented items such as shrinking the navigation menu into a dropdown from a button as opposed to a horizontal list inside a bar.,nfr

External constraints shall be considered after a meeting date and location have been proposed.,fr
For example if a high priority meeting needs to be accommodated a lower priority meeting be changed or cancelled or If a geographical disaster occurs which need to reschedule the meeting then the proposed meeting is cancelled.,fr
Conflict resolution shall be supported according to policies that have been stated by the client.,fr
All interactions between the meeting participants will be managed.,fr
There shall be means to communicate the message by participant.,fr
There shall be provision to invoke the participants not taking part in communication.,fr
The process of negotiation will also be managed.,fr
Moreover the reliability of communication will be monitored.,fr
The system should be usable by the nonexperts.,nfr
The user should be able to operate on the functionality easily.,nfr
The elapsed time between the user sending request for meeting and the date and location set should be minimal i.e.,nfr
the user should not wonder whether he has submitted the request or not.,nfr
Lower bound should be fixed between determination of meeting date and actual meeting EXTENSIBILITY The system should be able to handle explicit priorities among dates in preference sets.,nfr
It should handle explicit dependencies between meeting date and meeting location.,nfr
The system should provide provision to participant for his replacement by other person at the meeting.,nfr
PRIVACY Privacy rules should be enforced a nonprivileged participant should not be aware of constraints stated by other participants.,nfr
